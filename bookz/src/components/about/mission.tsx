        Our mission is to empower students by providing a platform where they
        can easily exchange books and summaries. We believe that education
        should be accessible to everyone, and our platform is designed to
        support this vision. By connecting students from various departments, we
        aim to create a vibrant community of learners who support each otherâ€™s
        academic journeys.
